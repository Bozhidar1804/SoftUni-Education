1.
INTERNET EXPLAINED:
 - Internet - vast network that connects billions of devices together
	- connections are made through ISPs - Internet Server Providers (интернет доставчик), companies
 - Network - a group of two or more devices that can communicate
HOW DOES THE INTERNET WORK?
 - All of the machines on the Internet are either Servers or Clients.
	- Servers - machines that provide services to other machines
	- Clients - machines that are used to connect to those services
 - Network Protocol - a set of rules and standards, that allow communication between devices
	- they include mechanisms for devices to identify and make connections with each other
 	- TCP, UDP, QUIC, IP, ARP
	- HTTP, FTP, TFTP, SMTP, SSH
PACKETS:
 - everything that is created on a computer is translated into digital data using Bits
 - bits are transmitted over the Internet after broken down into small chunks, called Packets
 - packets usually travel the network together, but they might have to take a different route to get to the destination

 - Each packet contains important information, called a Header
	- Where it came from; Where is it going; How long it is; How many packets are there in the overall message, all are the same size
INTERNET PROTOCOL:
 - all devices on the Internet have addresses
 - the IP address is unique to each computer or a device at the edge of the network
 - An IP Address has many parts, organized in a hierarchy: 192.168.14.120 (IPv4)
							   14 - Subnetworks; 120 - Device address;

 - IPv4 - sequence of 4 three-digit numbers
	- each number from 0 to 255
	- provides more than 4 billion 32-bits unique addresses, but not enough for all devices connected to the Internet
 	- CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing
		- IP addressing scheme that improves the allocation of IP addresses
		- allowing the use of variable-length subnet masks, instead of sticking to fixed Classes, you can specify a range of addresses more flexibly
		- this scheme greatly helped extend the life of IPv4

 - IPv6 - uses 128 bits, organized into eight 16-bit sections
 - Domain Name - human way to access IP addresses for devices and websites
	- a sequence of phrases that map to a giant Internet-wide database of IP addresses
 - DNS - Domain Name Server - a server that holds a cache of tons of domain names and their matching IP addresses

RELIABILITY and TCP:
 - when packets are transmitted from one location to another, they can take different paths. They reach the destination
unorganized nad sometimes not complete, so the me ssage needs to be audited and reviewed in order to put it together in the right way
 - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - uses a process, where it look at all the packets in a message and checks them
	- using the Header information in each packet
	- using Checklist, if it finds that a packet doesn't match the expected characteristic, it is discarded
	- verifies that all packets are: right ordered, no issues
	- after it certifies the data, the packets are merged together to recreate the original file that was on the sender's device
	- used for transmission of majority of data, mostly used

 - UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - does not guarantee data delivery
	- "fire-and-forget" procotol, sends data and it doesn't really care if the data is received at the other end
	- used when the Speed of the data transmission is important, and the reliability isn't as important

 - QUIC - new transport protocol, designed for mobile-heavy Internet usage
	- Uses UDP as its basis
	- packets are encrypted individually
	- handshake process

OSI MODEL:
 - Open System Interconnect - consist of 7 layers, each of them serves the one above it and the one below it
 - Helps with Troubleshooting and Communicating better
 - it's complicated and designed for Network Engineers and Communication Experts

TCP/IP Procotol:
 - in Software Development, a more simplified networking model
 - 4 layers:
	- Application - defines the way apps talk to each other
	- Transport - provides communication between 2 endpoints
	- Internet - transmits packets between 2 hosts
	- Link - combines physical media and data link protocols

NETWORK HARDWARE:
 - Cables - transmission media to transfer data
 - Routers - connecting device that transfers data packets (operates on level 3 of OSI)
 - Repeaters - receive a signal and regenerate it before re-transmitting, so it can travel longer distances
	- Hub - multiport repeater (level 1 of OSI)
	- Switch - receives data from a port, uses packet switching to resolve the destination device and forwards the data ot the particular destination (level 2 of OSI)
 - Bridges - connects two separate but similar Etherner network segments (level 2 of OSI)
 - Gateways - connects networks that work upon different protocols, entry and exit point of a network
	- controls access to other networks
	- level 4, 5, 6 or 7 of OSI (same as Firewalls)
 - NIC (Network Interface Cards) - a computer component that connects it to the network
	- two types: Internal and External

 !?! Ethernet is a technology used for local area networks (LANs), connecting devices within a specific area like a home or office. In short, the Internet connects computers globally, while Ethernet connects devices locally.

2.
HTTP PROTOCOL:
 - Communication Protocol - set of rules, which define how two or more parties are talking to each other
 - HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) - text-based client-server protocol
	- general-purpose client-server protocol used to transmit data across the web
	- relies on URLs
	- Request: Client - HTTP --> TCP --> IP --> Ethernet --> Media (wires/air/fiber) --> Ethernet --> IP --> TCP --> HTTP - Server
	- Response: vice versa
	- Stateless - each HTTP request is independent from others. Cookies and Web storages can overcome this
 - Status Codes:
	- 1xx (Informational): These codes indicate that the request has been received and the server is continuing to process it. Example: 100 Continue.
	- 2xx (Success): These codes mean the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted. Example: 200 OK.
	- 3xx (Redirection): These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request, often because the resource has moved. Example: 301 Moved Permanently.
	- 4xx (Client Error): These codes indicate that there was a problem with the request, usually because the client made a mistake. Example: 404 Not Found.
	- 5xx (Server Error): These codes mean the server failed to fulfill a valid request, often due to a problem on the server side. Example: 500 Internal Server Error.


URL (Uniform Resource Locator):
 - URL - formatted string, consisting of:
	- Network protocol - http, ftp, https
	- Host or IP address - softuni.org, gmail.com
	- Port - default is 80, in range [0...65535]
	- Path - /forum, /path/index.php
	- Query string (?id=27&lang=en)
	- Fragment - (#slides) - navigate to some section in the page
 - Encoded according RFC 1738

HTTP REQUEST:
 - request message sent by a client consists of:
	- HTTP request line
	- Request method - HTTP defines methods to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource (CRUD)
		- GET - Retrieve a resource
		- POST - Create / store a resource
		- PUT - Update (replace) a resource
		- DELETE - Delete (remove) a resource
			- PATCH - update a resource partially (modify)
			- HEAD - Retrieve the resource/s headers
	- Resource URI (URL)
	- Protocol version
	- HTTP request headers
	- HTTP request body - optional data, e.g., posted form fields

HTTP RESPONSE:
 - the response message sent by the HTTP server consists of:
	- HTTP response status line
	- Protocol version
	- Status code
	- Status phrase
	- Response headers - provide meta data about the returned resource
	- Response body - the content of the HTTP response (data)
 - has an option "Browser Redirection"
 - Content-Type response header specifies how the output should be processed (Disposition)

MIME and MEDIA TYPES:
 - MIME - Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions - internet standard for encoding resources
	- originally developed for email attachments
	- used in many Internet protocols like HTTP and SMTP

ROUTING:
 - Web Routing is a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them
	- the URL is parsed and then matching route is searched

WEB SERVER:
 - computer system that processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol
 - There are different Web Server Work Models!

HTML FORMS:
 - Action Attribute- defines where to submit the form data
 - Method Attribute - specifies the HTTP method to use when sending form data
 - GET vs POST Method - in SoftUni presentation, slide 46

HTTP/2:
 - a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the WWW
 - The main differences between HTTP and HTTP/2 are improvements in performance and efficiency.
	- Multiplexing - the art of handling multiple streams over a single TCP connection
		- HTTP - sends one request at a time over a connection
		- HTTP/2 - allows multiple requests to be sent and processed simultaneously on the same connection, speeding up the loading
		- Example: If your web page needs to load several images, HTTP will load them one by one, while HTTP/2 can load them all at the same time.
	- Header Compression - maintains a HTTP Header Table across requests, which optimizes communication.
		- The process is esentially a de-duplication, rather than compression.
		- HTTP - sends headers (like cookies and other info) as plain text for every request, which can add a lot of extra data
		- HTTP/2 - compresses headersr, reducing the amount of data sent
	- Server Push - the process of sending resources to clients, without them having to ask for it
		- HTTP - the browser has to request each resource (like CSS or JavaScript) after it sees the HTML needs it
		- HTTP/2 - the server can proactively send resources to the browser before it asks, speeding the process up
